# The Bug Fixers

[The deployed github page](https://fac27.github.io/FAC-webAgency/)

## About the site
This is a project for a software development bootcamp at Founders and Coders. We were asked to develop a website for an agency, we decided on a post-apocalyptic pest-control agency. For some reason.

## About the agency
The Bug Fixers are a fictional team of highly trained professionals, dedicated to protecting what remains of humanity from the various pests that have overrun the world in the wake of the great pestilence.

## User stories

As a user I want to:
- [ ] Be able to browse this site on a mobile or desktop device
- [ ] Find information about the services offered
- [ ] Navigate the website easily with mouse or keyboard
- [ ] Navigate the website with a screen reader
- [ ] Find out about the personnel
- [ ] Be able to send a message making an enquiry

## Approach

We have maintained a mobile first approach so there is expected deformation when viewing on a desktop, we have almost strictly kept our html tags to semantic element tags for accessibility purposes and have succefully sustained a 100% lighthouse rating while monitoring screen reader access. We have emphasised a strong structure in our css for readability, using 'chapters' to chunk related primitives and have also conserved a BEM naming convention where necessary. We're keeping everything on one page for the moment, but this may change as content is added.

## Next steps

We're going to add sections on services and pricing and a photo gallery. We're also going to develop the desktop version of the site.
